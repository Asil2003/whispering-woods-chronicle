Elara is a brave and curious 14-year-old villager with wild chestnut curls and sharp green eyes that seem to notice everything. Often seen climbing trees or exploring forgotten paths, she never feared the forest like the others. When she discovered the map, something deep within her whispered: destiny.

Shadow is a sleek, silver-eyed wolf with a coat like moonlight and a silent tread. Fiercely loyal to Elara, he appeared from the mist the night she found the map, as if drawn by fate. Though untamed by nature, Shadow walks beside her as protector, guide, and silent confidant.
