In the quiet village of Elmsmere, nestled between silver-tipped hills and the ancient forest of Myrwynn, sixteen-year-old Liora stumbled upon a brittle scroll tucked beneath the floorboards of her late grandfather’s cottage. Inked with strange symbols and shifting lines that seemed to shimmer in torchlight, the map pulsed with an eerie life of its own. Whispers curled around her ears as if the woods themselves beckoned. She had heard the tales—of lost kings, hidden relics, and a forest that watched—but none spoke of a map that changed. Gripping the parchment, Liora knew her fate no longer lay in Elmsmere, but deep within the whispering woods.
